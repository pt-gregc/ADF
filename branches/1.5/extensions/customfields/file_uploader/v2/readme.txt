v2 - 2011-09-07 - RAK
This version is vastly improved, notable features include:
 * configuration CFC
 * configurable validation functions
 * configurable thubmnail generation

To use this version simply copy and paste the sampleUploader.cfc into your site directory,
 rename it to be the name of the CFC you plan on working with. If you wish to have thumbnail
 support add <yourRenamedUploaderFile>_getThumbnail</yourRenamedUploaderFile> to the
 proxyWhiteList.xml in your site. Feel free to override any functionality to meet your needs.
 If you implement any neat features on your local install I request that you send them back
 to the paperthin team so we can integrate that into the file uploader.

Enjoy!
