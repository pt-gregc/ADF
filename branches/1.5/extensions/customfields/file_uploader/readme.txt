The File Uploader CFT has undergone a major reconstruction which is found in the V2 folder
We recommend using File Uploader V2, although in an effort to maintain backwards compatibility the v1 files are still available in the root of the File Uploader CFT folder.

If you are implementing a new file uploader CFT please refer to the documentation inside the latest released version (v2).
